* Introduction
- Welcom to the mobile app of "Interactive Phonetics".
- In learning phonetics, it is necessary to learn a set of symbols with witch
  one may notate speech sounds. The most commonly used alphabet for this purpose
  is the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) developed by the International
  Phonetic Association (established 1886 in Paris).
- The IPA contains a list of symbols (phonetic letters). Each of these letters
  represents an unit of linguistic sound known as a phone/segment.

** Consonants
- In the articulation of consonants, there is always some kind of obstruction to
  the airflow. This obstruction may be thorough or partial. The ways
  obstructions occur are listed vertically along the first column. These are
  known as manners of articulation. Obstruction may occur in different regions,
  from the lips (labial), to the teeth (dental) to the alveolar, the palate, the
  velum, the pharynx and the glottal. These are known as places of articulation.
